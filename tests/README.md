# Film-Juicer public tests

The public suite is organized by product domain and has one normal scheduler:
CTest. C++ tests use ordinary executables and selective GoogleTest discovery;
Python tests use `unittest`. Reference generation and benchmarks are explicit
maintenance operations, never hidden parts of a correctness run.

## Prerequisites

- CMake 4.3 or newer and Ninja.
- CUDA Toolkit 13.2, including its host runtime libraries. The project still
  configures CUDA even for host-only test selection.
- Linux: GCC/G++ 13 at `/usr/bin/g++-13`.
- Windows: Visual Studio 18, ClangCL from its LLVM tools, and NVCC with the VS
  18 MSVC host compiler.
- Python 3.13. Ordinary Python execution is intentionally tested on 3.13.
- A compatible NVIDIA driver and SM 7.5-or-newer GPU only for the `gpu` label.

Select the CUDA 13.2 installation through CMake's standard environment inputs
when it is not already the system default. This keeps machine-specific toolkit
paths out of the shared presets:

```sh
export CUDAToolkit_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/cuda-13.2
export CUDACXX="$CUDAToolkit_ROOT/bin/nvcc"
```

The configure step rejects a compiler or toolkit outside the CUDA 13.2 series.
These variables only select the installation; NVCC continues to use the GCC 13
host compiler fixed by the Linux preset.

Create an isolated ordinary-test environment on Linux:

```sh
python3.13 -m venv out/test-venv/linux
. out/test-venv/linux/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

If `python3.13` is unavailable but `uv` is installed, let `uv` provision the
interpreter and environment:

```sh
uv python install 3.13
uv venv --python 3.13 out/test-venv/linux
uv pip install --python out/test-venv/linux/bin/python \
  -r tests/requirements.txt
. out/test-venv/linux/bin/activate
```

The equivalent `uv` setup on Windows is:

```powershell
uv venv --python 3.13 out/test-venv/windows
uv pip install --python out/test-venv/windows/Scripts/python.exe `
  -r tests/requirements.txt
```

On Windows, start from the Visual Studio 18 developer environment, make the
VS LLVM directory and CUDA 13.2 available as required by the project presets,
then run:

```powershell
py -3.13 -m venv out/test-venv/windows
out/test-venv/windows/Scripts/Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

GoogleTest 1.18.0 is fetched only when `BUILD_TESTING=ON`; its release archive
is checksum-pinned in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`. For an offline checkout, use
CMake's standard override with an already extracted source tree:

```sh
cmake --preset linux-debug -DBUILD_TESTING=ON \
  -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_GOOGLETEST=/absolute/path/to/googletest
```

## Build and run

Linux Debug:

```sh
cmake --preset linux-debug -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build --preset linux-debug
ctest --preset linux-debug
```

Windows Debug uses the same sequence with `windows-clang-debug`. Release uses
`linux-release` or `windows-clang-release`.

The unfiltered CTest command runs every automated correctness group applicable
to that platform and therefore requires a supported GPU and driver. Selection
uses standard CTest options:

```sh
ctest --preset linux-debug -N
ctest --preset linux-debug -L host
ctest --preset linux-debug -L gpu
ctest --preset linux-debug -L reference
ctest --preset linux-debug -R ScatterHalation
ctest --preset linux-debug -R Gamma
ctest --preset linux-debug --rerun-failed --output-on-failure
```

On a normal GPU development machine, prefer the single unfiltered command.
Labels are for CI, machines without a GPU, and focused diagnosis; they are not
additional passes that must be run after the full suite.

`host` means execution does not require an NVIDIA driver or device. It still
requires the CUDA 13.2 toolkit to configure/build and may load toolkit runtime
libraries. `gpu` means the executable loader or the case itself needs the
driver/device. `reference` is an additional meaning label for cases checked
against a defined external authority; each such test still has exactly one
execution requirement (`host` or `gpu`). CUDA test processes share one CTest
resource lock.

The Python comparator can also be debugged directly:

```sh
python3.13 -m unittest discover -s tests/gamma -p test_compare.py -v
```

Turning testing off preserves the normal plug-in build and performs no
GoogleTest fetch or Python discovery:

```sh
cmake --preset linux-debug -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
cmake --build --preset linux-debug
```

## Suite map

| Domain | Meaning | Execution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scatter_halation/recipe_descriptor_test.cpp` | Product contracts for control validation, recipe identity, descriptor dispatch, public-resource bootstrap and profile loading | `host` |
| `scatter_halation/integration_test*` | Production-linked preparation, CUDA operator fixtures, route/carrier behavior, zero-work and lifecycle contracts | `gpu`; selected fixtures are also `reference` |
| `diffusion/host_reference_test.cpp` | Production host diffusion behavior against the pinned spektrafilm cohort | `host`, `reference` |
| `gamma/test_compare.py` | Comparator bounds, applicability, non-finite rejection and CLI failure propagation | `host` |
| `ofx/probe.py` | Linux synthetic OFX load/describe/unload and declared CUDA support | `host`, Linux only |

The diffusion fixture is an external reference. The scatter binary fixture is
also an external reference with revision, shape, channel order and numerical
limits recorded in its manifest. Gamma comparator rows are product/tooling
contracts; they do not make the stale historical gamma captures current.

Generated binaries live under `out/build/<preset>/tests/bin/`. CMake stages one
read-only runtime tree at `out/build/<preset>/tests/Resources/`. Test scratch
and failure artifacts go below `out/validation/<preset>/`. Checked-in fixtures
are read-only during an ordinary run.

## Diagnosing a failure

CTest prints the failing case, actual/expected values and relevant tolerance.
Run the named domain with `-R` and `--output-on-failure`; add `-V` when the
underlying command and paths are needed. GPU diagnostics retain case, route,
fixture and CUDA failure detail. A missing driver/device is a failure for a
selected `gpu` test, not a skip.

CTest can write JUnit output without a project-specific report layer:

```sh
ctest --preset linux-debug -L host \
  --output-junit out/validation/linux-debug/host-junit.xml
```

## Adding a regression case

For a small host C++ regression, add a normal `TEST(Suite, Name)` block to the
domain's existing GoogleTest source and rebuild. CMake discovers the case; no
registry or wrapper edit is required. Use production headers/targets and keep
the assertion at a product boundary.

For gamma comparator behavior, add a `unittest.TestCase` method to
`test_compare.py`. For a new integration executable or destructive lifecycle
group, declare one explicit CTest process in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`, give it a
finite timeout and its actual `host`/`gpu` requirement, and keep destructive
transitions isolated.

Fixtures must state whether they express a product contract, a Film-Juicer
characterization, or an external reference. Never regenerate or widen an
expectation from CTest. Reference updates are separate reviewed changes written
first to `out/validation/`.

## Boundaries and limitations

- The build still requires CUDA 13.2 even for `-L host`; a toolkit-free C++
  mode is outside this consolidation.
- Standard public CI runs Linux host/reference-host and Python checks. CUDA,
  Windows, installed-Resolve-library and Resolve-render evidence are reported
  separately.
- The historical gamma capture baseline remains deferred because its resource
  inventory and `Release`/`Release-Clang` identities do not establish current
  four-preset applicability. Two G09 captures are configuration-invalid and
  remain excluded, as detailed in `MIGRATION.md`.
- Reference generators require their own pinned environments and are not part
  of ordinary unittest discovery.

See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for the bounded family inventory and exact
retained/deferred/archive decisions, [benchmarks/README.md](benchmarks/README.md)
for measurement commands, and [manual/resolve.md](manual/resolve.md) for
owner-run host acceptance.
