# Contributing to Film-Juicer

Film-Juicer keeps photographic policy in immutable recipes and descriptors,
with CUDA code binding or executing those decisions. Preserve arithmetic
order, units, channel order, hashes, seeds, stage order, external identifiers,
and asynchronous lifetime while changing implementation language or structure.

## Design and ownership

- Give each process, instance, context, frame, and local resource one clear
  owner and teardown path. Prefer plain values, short-lived borrows, and RAII.
- Add a type, field, cache, or helper only for a current consumer. Keep helpers
  in the owning module and avoid generic managers, service layers, or fallback
  paths without a present contract.
- Validate external input at its construction or admission boundary. Complete
  immutable profiles, recipes, and descriptors are trusted by downstream
  consumers until a real external, numerical, or lifetime boundary intervenes.
- Rust core code is safe and CUDA/OFX independent. Raw foreign operations stay
  at the named plug-in or native boundary; native CUDA resources remain owned
  by the exact context and epoch.

## Naming

Use the shortest name that preserves the distinction visible at the call site.
Rust types and variants use `PascalCase`; functions, modules, fields, and values
use `snake_case`; constants use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. Familiar type acronyms
are `Rgb`, `Lut`, `Ofx`, and `Cuda`. New native free functions use
`snake_case`, while retained owners may keep their established readable member
casing. Preserve unit and representation names such as `camera_ev`,
`sigma_px`, `radius_um`, `row_bytes`, `density_cmy`, and `context_epoch`.
External OFX strings, profile keys, ABI tags, and fixture identifiers do not
change as part of an internal rename.

## Failure behavior

Expected input, allocation, preparation, CUDA, and host failures return typed
outcomes. Do not silently reuse older state, skip an enabled effect, parse
diagnostic text as policy, or introduce an output-changing fallback. Cleanup
and panic/exception containment belong at the owning boundary. Never reset a
CUDA context owned by a live Resolve process.

## Required checks

Rust is pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml` to 1.98.1 with its rustfmt and Clippy
components. Native formatting and tidy use LLVM 22; on Windows the qualified
tools are under
`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Community\VC\Tools\Llvm\x64\bin`.
Configure the requested CMake preset, explicitly enabling tests before CTest:

```sh
cmake --preset linux-debug -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build --preset linux-debug
python scripts/check-quality.py --base <accepted-parent> --preset linux-debug
ctest --preset linux-debug --output-on-failure
```

Use the corresponding Windows or Release preset when that is the affected
target. `--files <paths...>` is the bounded package form; `--all-owned` is an
explicit audit. The dispatcher writes logs only under
`out/validation/<preset>/quality/`, leaves source unchanged, and treats missing
tools or compiler/lint failures as incomplete work. Formatting and lints do
not replace review of ownership, names, numerical parity, GPU lifetime, or
installed Resolve behavior.
